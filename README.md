**Here is an Overview of my Cybersecurity Final Project 2024**

**Ransomware Attack Analysis on Change Healthcare Data Breaches**

**Source: NBC NEWS** **According to NBC NEWS**  **[Ransomware attack on U.S. health care payment processor ‘most serious incident of its kind](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/ransomware-attack-us-health-care-payment-processor-serious-incident-ki-rcna141322)**

**I did a comprehensive analysis of the Change Healthcare ransomware attack, identifying vulnerabilities and assessing the impact on patient privacy. Developed recommendations for strengthening cybersecurity measures, including network segmentation, data encryption, and employee training. Contributed to the development of an incident response plan to mitigate the effects of future breaches.**
___________________________________________________________


**For this project, I chose the topic of 'Securing Systems,' focusing specifically on a recent ransomware attack on a U.S. healthcare payment processor. I found this incident in the news and decided to explore it further because it aligns perfectly with the course's project requirements, which emphasize analyzing real-world failures in cybersecurity.**

**This topic caught my attention because securing systems is a critical part of cybersecurity, and ransomware attacks are increasingly becoming a major threat, especially in sectors as sensitive as healthcare. The incident I chose is described as 'the most serious of its kind,' highlighting the significant impact that such attacks can have on both the organization and its users.**

**By analyzing this incident, I aim to understand the vulnerabilities that led to the attack, how it could have been prevented, and the broader implications for cybersecurity practices. This directly ties into what we’ve learned in the course, particularly around the importance of safeguarding systems and data against such threats. I believe this case study will provide valuable insights into the practical application of cybersecurity principles.**
